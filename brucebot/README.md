This is a repository for the twitter bot that learns how to talk like Bruce Springsteen.  The lyrics are in the input1.txt file in this folder.  The code that I used to retrieve the lyrics from [A-Z Lyrics](http://www.azlyrics.com/) is also included in the repository as an R script.  The script for scraping the songs does not retrieve all the songs but most of them, it's a bit clunky but it works.  

See [mxnet.io](http://mxnet.io) for more info on how to set parameters and build the RNN model that produces the text.
