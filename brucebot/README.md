This is code for a twitter bot that learns how to talk like Bruce Springsteen.  The lyrics are in the input1.txt file in this folder.  The code that I used to retrieve the lyrics is also included in the repository.  See [mxnet.io](http://mxnet.io) for more info on how to set parameters and build the model.
