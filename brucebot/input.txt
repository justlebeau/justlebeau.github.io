Teardrops on the city
Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Seem like the whole world walking pretty
And you can't find the room to move
Well everybody better move over, that's all
'Cause I'm running on the bad side
And I got my back to the wall
Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out

Well I was stranded in the jungle
Trying to take in all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright
And lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out
And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
And kid you better get the picture
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
And I can't go home

When the change was made uptown
And the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city
All the little pretties raise their hands
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half
With the Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out
41 shots, and we'll take that ride
'Cross the bloody river to the other side
41 shots, cut through the night
You're kneeling over his body in the vestibule
Praying for his life

Is it a gun, is it a knife
Is it a wallet, this is your life
It ain't no secret (it ain't no secret)

No secret my friend
You can get killed just for living in your American skin

41 shots, Lena gets her son ready for school
She says, "On these streets, Charles
You've got to understand the rules
If an officer stops you, promise me you'll always be polite
And that you'll never ever run away
Promise Mama you'll keep your hands in sight"

Is it a gun (is it a gun), is it a knife (is it a knife)

I was born by the river in a little tent
And just like that river I've been running ever since
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will

It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
Cos I don't know what's out there beyond the sky
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will

And then I go to see my brother
And I ask him to help me please
And he just winds up knockin' me
Back down on my knees

There were times when I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will
Tonight my bag is packed
Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks
That'll lead me across the border

Tomorrow my love and I
Will sleep 'neath auburn skies
Somewhere across the border

We'll leave behind, my dear
Pain and sadness we found here
And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy waters

Where the sky grows gray and white
We'll meet on the other side
There across the border

For you I'll build a house
High up on a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border

Where pain and memory
Pain and memory have been stilled
There across the border

And sweet blossoms fill the air
Pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool clear waters

And in your arms 'neath open skies
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes
There across the border

Tonight we'll sing the songs
I'll dream of you my corazon
And tomorrow my heart will be strong

And may the saints' blessings and grace
Carry me safely into your arms
There across the border

For what are we
Without hope in our hearts
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters

And eat the fruit from the vine
I know love and fortune will be mine
Somewhere across the border
In the summer that I was baptized, my father held me to his side
As they put me to the water, he said how on that day I cried
We were prisoners of love, a love in chains
He was standin' in the door, I was standin' in the rain
With the same hot blood burning in our veins
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

All of the old faces ask you why you're back
They fit you with position and the keys to your daddy's Cadillac
In the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name
You remember the faces, the places, the names
You know it's never over, it's relentless as the rain
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

(Yeahhh...)
In the Bible, mamma, Cain slew Abel and East of Eden, mamma, he was cast
You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past
Well
Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain
Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame
But you inherit the sins, you inherit the flames
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)
Adam raised a Cain
Well I wanna tell the world about the girl I love
She's the kind of girl that I'll be dreaming of
Oh she's so sincere when she holds me tight
Makes me ??? she makes me feel alright

You know she's got a sweet sweet kiss in her true true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
You know she's got a sweet sweet kiss in her true true heart
She's fine fine fine
She's fine fine fine
Shes a fine fine girl

Well she even takes me shopping and she buys me things
Her love is more important than a diamond ring
Oh and when she kisses ??? by her side
Make sure ??? make sure that she's alright

You know she's got a sweet sweet kiss in her true true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
You know she's got a sweet sweet kiss in her true true heart
She's fine fine fine
She's fine fine fine
She's a fine fine girl

She's got a sweet sweet kiss in her true true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
She's got a sweet sweet kiss in her true true heart
She's fine fine fine
She's fine fine fine
She's a fine fine super fine girl

(Spector, Greenwich, Barry) by Darlene
A-one, two, three, go

Daddy always told me money don't mean everything
Consider yourself a lucky man, you got a guitar and you still can sing
As usual my Daddy was right

I got two kids, two cats, a good dog and a lucky hat
An old house, a fast car, but I don't go very far
I got a beautiful wife and I'm leading a good life

Well I wake up in the morning at the crack of dawn, hit the clock before it rings
I work hard all day but at quitting time I forget about everything
I walk out those doors and back into the light

Whoa! Hey!
I got two kids, two cats, a good dog and a lucky hat
An old house, a fast car, but I don't go very far
I got a beautiful wife and I'm leading a good life
I'm leading a good life

Just because they sign my check that don't mean they own my soul
It took me a while to figure it out but Daddy now I know

As usual my Daddy was right

I have two kids, two cats, a good dog and a lucky hat
An old house, a fast car, but I don't go very far
I got a beautiful wife and I'm leading a good life
I'm living a good life
I'm living a good life
I'm living a good life

Whoa! Whoa!
Na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na-na-na
Na-na na-na na-na

Well you don't like, don't like the way I walk
And you don't like, don't like the way I talk
You criticize about me endlessly
Logic defies how you get stuck with me
And you complain about the clothes I wear
And you explain there's other boys out there
You complain my car makes too much noise
And you cry I'm always out with the boys

Whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I give up little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you

You complain the way I love you at night
You explain I'm really not your type
If we go out, you say I'm such a bore
If we stay in, you say what are we living for
I don't understand, there's nothing I can do
There ain't no way I can satisfy you
End of the night I lean in for a kiss
Here comes the pitch, a swing and a miss

Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, well you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you, hey!
Hey!
(Come on boys!)

Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Hey hey little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
No matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you

I tried to change, I got a job in sales
I bought a shirt uptown in Bloomindales
And babe I tried to make the latest scene
Hitting cool just like Jimmy Iovine
I bought a record with all the latest grooves
A book of love with all the latest moves
I bought some flowers and I waited at your door
And you came out, didn't want to see me no more

Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Hey! Hey! Hey!
No matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Aww no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Whoaaa!
One, two, three, four

Blind man wavin' by the side of the road
I'm in a flat bed Ford carrying a heavy load
With a sweet thing sippin' on a blueberry wine
On a flat black highway down in Carolina
Black bird slippin' in a sky of blue

All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you, honey
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Little boy carryin' a fishin' pole
Little girl pickin' berries straight off of the vine (hooo)
Brown bag filled with a little green toad
We hook 'em through the lip and throw 'em off of the line
Your sweet brown legs got me feeling so blue

And all I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
There ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Black car shinin' on a Sunday morn (hooo)
Mama go to church now, Mama go to church now (hooo)
Friday night daddy's shirt is torn
Daddy's goin' downtown, Daddy's goin' downtown
Ain't no one understand this sweet thing we do

All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
All I'm thinkin' about is you, baby
All I'm thinkin' about is you
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Woah
Woahhh

Field turned up, the seed is sowed
Rain comin' in from over 'cross the road
Big black curtain coming 'cross the field
Blind'll see, the lame will be healed
Brown eyed girl, I turned my back on you, now it's lonely

All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe
All I'm thinkin' about is you
And all I'm thinkin' about is you, babe
All I'm thinkin' about is you
Ain't nothin' in this world take away these blues
All I'm thinkin' about is you

All I'm thinkin' about is you, babe
All I'm thinkin' about is you
Baby, all I'm thinkin' about is you
Yeah, all I'm thinkin' about is you
Ain't nothin' in this world I can do about it
All I'm thinkin' about is you

Woahhh
Woahhh
Woahhh
Whoa!

Yeah I know what it's like to have failed, baby
With the whole world lookin' on
I know what it's like to have soared
And come crashin' like a drunk on a bar room floor*

And now you got no reason to trust me
My confidence is a little rusty
But if you don't feel like bein' alone
Baby, I could walk you all the way home

Well now our old fears and failures
Oh baby, they do linger
Like the shadow of that ring
Hmmm, that was on your finger
Those days they've come and gone
Baby, I could walk you all the way home

Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!

Yeah love leaves nothin' but shadows and vapor
We go on, as is our sad nature
Baby
Now it's some old Stones' song the band is trashin'
If you feel like dancin', baby I'm askin'

It's comin' on closing time
Bartender, he's ringin' last call
These days I don't stand on pride
And I ain't afraid to take a fall

So if you're seein' what you like
Maybe your first choice he's gone
Well that's all right
Baby, I could walk you all the way home
Baby, I could walk you all the way home

Whoa!
Yeah!
Whoa hoo!
Whoa!
Whoa hoo!
Yeah!
Whoa hoo!
Come on!
Oh yeah!

Whoa!

What is this land America, so many travel there
I'm going now while I'm still young, my darling meet me there
Wish me luck my lovely, I'll send for you when I can
And we'll make our home in the American land

Over there all the women wear silk and satin to their knees
And children, dear, the sweets, I hear, are growing on the trees
Gold comes rushing out the rivers straight into your hands
When you make your home in the American land

There's diamonds in the sidewalk, the gutters lined in song
Dear, I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who'll make his home in the American land

Whoa!

Whoa!

I docked at Ellis Island in the city of light and spire
I wandered to the valley of red-hot steel and fire
We made the steel that built the cities with the sweat of our two hands
We made our home in the American land

Go!
There's diamonds in the sidewalk, the gutters lined in song
Dear, I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who'll make his home in the American land

Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
???!
Come on!

The McNicholas, the Posalskis, the Smiths, Zerillis too
The Blacks, the Irish, Italians, the Germans and the Jews
They come across the water a thousand miles from home
With nothing in their bellies but the fire down below

They died building the railroads, they worked to bones and skin
They died in the fields and factories, names scattered in the wind
They died to get here a hundred years ago, they're still dying now
Their hands that built the country we're always trying to keep out

There's diamonds in the sidewalk, the gutters lined in song
Dear, I hear that beer flows through the faucets all night long
There's treasure for the taking, for any hard working man
Who'll make his home in the American land
Who'll make his home in the American land
Who'll make his home in the American land
Whoa!

Shrieks of sheikhs as they come across the movie screen
A thousand sand dune soldiers led by an Arabian queen
Harem girls move like Clancy's dancers through my dirty dreams
I wake up on the floor clutching a bed lamp

Mama comes in, she screams, "Whoa, you been out with that tramp again last night
That silver sequined Arab black bitch, you know, the one Mama don't like"
But, Mama, she sings me moontime melodies with this great Top 40 hook
Mama just stares and Papa don't care but he says, "Look Mama, the girl's alright, the girl's 
alright"

He turns and says, "Tell me, son, what's the word?" 'Cause, you know, he can't hear
Papa the word's out on the curb but don't go near it
It's criticized as too absurd, even the animals fear it
Papa says, "Fetch me my flashlight, son," and he stumbles out the front door

So come out from behind your bunkers 'cause the liftoff's been a bust
Papa's gone and Mama's dead and buried in my rocket dust
Well, you're alone now for the first time, don't worry 'cause that's all right
All fear will completely disappear come the Arabian night
Hmmm

Now soundman smiles and turns the dials to set the meter reading rising
He pulls the singer's voice from out of his pocket to see if the audience likes it
And in the very first row sits sweet Jenny Row with a bell on her shoe and she wants him to make it
He flicks a switch but Jenny moves too fast and the audience sways to the sound of her shotgun blast
The manager comes running out from behind stage, says, "Check the band's arms for bullet holes, make that man roll up his sleeves"
The drummer shoots himself with cyanide then asked to be relieved
And me, I just say, "It's too crazy in here, which is the stage door out? I gotta get up tomorrow morning for work"
The promoter said, "Once you're in they all lead out, but what's the matter, man, ain't you heard?
There's a war going on on the outside and I'm paying you to sing like a bird
So get in and get tough or get up and get out 'cause things aren't too tight"
I said, "Don't worry, man, everything's gonna loosen up come the Arabian night
Oh yes, whoa, come the Arabian night"

Well, I got back in bed but outside my window I heard another gang fight
It's Duke and the boys against The Devil's best men and both sides have drawn their knives
Now Duke he's a well known knife fighter and with one quick jab he brings The Devil down
He smiles 'cause he knows there's a good bounty on Devil's in any God fearing town
So Duke sold The Devil to some priest in Pennsylvania to exhibit on his altar Christmas night
But The Devil's eyes, they're still burn red with fire as long as Duke walks upright
And he swears there's going to be a showdown come sundown on the Arabian night
Whoa, on the Arabian, the Arabian, Arabian night, ???
Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
'Cause I'm so afraid
That we will have to part

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love

One day I feel so happy
Next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll learn
To take the good with the bad

'Cause each night
I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love

I cried a tear for nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through
Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say goodbye
I'd still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love

I cried a tear for nobody but you
I'll be a lonely one
If you should say we're through
Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you should say goodbye
I'd still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love
Why must I be a teenager in love
Why must I be a teenager in love
Why 
must I be a teenager in love
Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night
Now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're getting ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busting in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
And the gambling commissions hanging on by the skin of its teeth

Well now everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus

Now baby everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
But with you forever I'll stay
We're going out where the sand's turning to gold
So put on your stockings, baby, 'cause the night's getting cold

And maybe everything dies, that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back

Hoo hoo

Now I've been looking for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of coming out on this losing end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm gonna do a little favor for him

Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your hair up nice and set up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City
One soft infested summer me and Terry became friends
Trying in vain to breathe the fire we was born in
Catching rides to the outskirts, tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house, getting wasted in the heat
And hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets
Na, na na na

Slow dancing in the dark on the beach at Stockton's Wing
Where desperate lovers park we sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night when you let loose of everything
To go running on the backstreets, running on the backstreets
Terry you swore we'd live forever
Taking it on them backstreets together
Yeah

Endless juke joints and Valentino drag
Where dancers scraped the tears up off the street dressed down in rags
Running into the darkness, some hurt bad some really dying
At night sometimes it seemed you could hear that whole damn city crying
Blame it on the lies that killed us, blame it on the truth that ran us down
You can blame it all on me Terry, it don't matter to me now
When the breakdown hit at midnight there was nothing left to say
But I hated him and I hated you when you went away
Whoah, whoah
Whoah, whoah

Now laying here in the dark, you're like an angel on my chest
Just another tramp of hearts crying tears of faithlessness
Remember all the movies, Terry, we'd go see
Trying to learn how to walk like the heroes we thought we had to be
Well after all this time to find we're just like all the rest
Stranded in the park and forced to confess
To hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Well we swore forever friends, hey!
On the backstreets until the end

Uh, uh, uh
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
It's alright
To go hiding on the backstreets tonight
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets, hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
Whoah!
Hey!
Whoahhh!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
Whoah, oh, oh
Whoo, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooh
Lights out tonight, trouble in the heartland
Got a head-on collision smashing in my guts man
I'm caught in a crossfire that I don't understand
But there's one thing I know for sure
Girl, I don't give a damn for the same old played out scenes
Baby, I don't give a damn for just the in-betweens
Honey, I want the heart, I want the soul,
I want control right now
You better listen to me baby, talk about a dream, try to make it real
You wake up in the night with a fear so real
You spend your life waiting for a moment that just don't come
Well don't waste your time waiting

Badlands, you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
We'll keep pushing till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good

Working in the field till you get your back burned
Working 'neath the wheels till you get your facts learned
Baby, I got my facts learned real good right now
You better get it straight, darling 
Poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king
And a king ain't satisfied till he rules everything
I wanna go out tonight, I wanna find out what I got
Well I believe in the love that you gave me
I believe in the faith that could save me
I believe in the hope and I pray that some day it may raise me above these

Badlands, you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
Keep pushing till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good
Awhoa whoa whoa whoa

For the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive
I wanna find one face that ain't looking through me
I wanna find one place, I wanna spit in the face of these

Badlands, you gotta live it every day
Let the broken hearts stand as the price you've gotta pay
Keep moving till it's understood
And these badlands start treating us good
Awhoa whoa whoa whoa
He lay his blanket underneath the freeway
As the evening sky grew dark
Took a sniff of toncho from his coke can
And headed through Balboa Park
Where the men in their Mercedes
Come nightly to employ
In the cool San Diego evening
The services of the border boys

He grew up near the Zona Norte
With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with
He swallowed their balloons of cocaine
Brought 'em across the Twelfth Street strip
Sleeping in a shelter
If the night got too cold
Runnin' from the migra
Of the border patrol

Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks
And in through the storm drain
They stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway
And each one took a name
There was X-man and Cochise
Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud
They come north to California
End up with the poison in their blood

He did what he had to do for the money
Sometimes he sent home what he could spare
The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho
And jeans like the gavachos wear

One night the border patrol swept Twelfth Street
A big car come fast down the boulevard
Spider stood caught in its headlights
Got hit and went down hard
As the car sped away Spider held his stomach
Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass
Lie there tasting his own blood on his tongue
Closed his eyes and listened to the cars
Rushin' by so fast
Well my soul checked out missing as I sat listening
To the hours and minutes tickin' away
Yeah just sittin' around waitin' for my life to begin
While it was all just slippin' away
I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come
Or that train to come roarin' 'round the bend
I got a new suit of clothes a pretty red rose
And a woman I can call my friend

These are better days baby
Yeah there's better days shining through
These are better days baby
Better days with a girl like you

Well I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss
It's like eatin' caviar and dirt
It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending
A rich man in a poor man's shirt
Now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon
Your heart like a diamond shone
Tonight I'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms
Out of these heard luck bones

These are better days baby
These are better days it's true
These are better days
There's better days shining through

Now a life of leisure and a pirate's treasure
Don't make much for tragedy
But it's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin
And can't stand the company
Every fool's got a reason to feelin' sorry for himself
And turning his heart to stone
Tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell
And I feel like I'm comin' home

These are better days baby
There's better days shining through
These are better days
Better days with a girl like you

These are better days baby
These are better days it's true
These are better days
Better days are shining through
Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
Till you spend half your life just covering upBorn in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Got in a little hometown jam so they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land to go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says "son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said "son don't you understand now"
Had a brother at Khe Sahn fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A.
I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A.
In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream 
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on highway 9, 
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line 
h-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run 

yes, girl we were

Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend 
I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
and strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
h-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire 
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

1-2-3-4!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
but there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
h-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when 
we're gonna get to that place 
Where we really wanna go 
and we'll walk in the sun 
But till then tramps like us 
baby we were born to run 

Oh honey, tramps like us
baby we were born to run 

Come on with me, tramps like us
baby we were born to run 

Ru-uh-uh-un
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Uh-uh-uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-uh-un
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ru-uh-uh-un
I had a friend was a big baseball player back in high school (yeah)
He could throw that speedball by you, make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar, I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks, but all he kept talking about was

Glory days
Well they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days

(Alright)

Well there's a girl that lives up the block, back in school she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby, well, they split up, I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times, she says when she feels like crying, she starts laughing thinking about

Glory days
Yeah they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days

(Alright boys, watch ???)
Rockin' now!
Whoa!

Think I'm going down to the well tonight and I'm gonna drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it, but I probably will
Yeah just sitting back trying to recapture a little of the glory of
Well but time slips away and leaves you with nothing mister but boring stories of

Glory days
Yeah they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days
Yeah they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days
I was standing by the river where the cold black water runs
I was standing by the river where the cold black water runs
I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun

I had all the earthly riches, I had each and every one
I had all the earthly riches, I had each and every one
But I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun

Well I swore to you my darling, that you were the only one
Yes I swore to you my darling, you were the only one
I had my good eye to the dark and my blind eye to the sun
Well I stood stone-like at midnight suspended in my masquerade
And I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strode all alone into a fallout zone, came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, when they said "sit down" I stood up
Ooh, ooh, growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
And I pushed B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd, when they said "come down" I threw up
Ooh, ooh, growin' up
Looking back, now!

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard to hold your breath
Swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
But my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd, when they said "pull down" I pulled up
Ooh, ooh, growin' up
The speculators made their money on the blood you shed
Your momma's pulled the sheets up off your bed
The profiteers on Jane Street sold your shoes and clothes
Ain't nobody talkin' because everybody knows
We pulled your cycle up back to the garage and polished up the chrome
Our gypsy biker's comin' home

Sister Mary sits with your colors, brother John is drunk and gone
This whole town's been rousted, which side are you on?
The favored march up over the hill in some fools parade
Shoutin' victory for the righteous but there ain't much here but graves
Ain't nobody talkin', we're just waitin' on the phone
Gypsy biker's comin' home
We rode her into the foothills, Bobby brought the gasoline
We stood 'round her in a circle as she lit up the ravine
The spring high desert wind rushed down on us all the way back home

To the dead, well it don't matter much 'bout who's wrong or right
You asked me that question, I didn't get it right
You slipped into your darkness, now all that remains
Is my love for you brother, lying still and unchanged
To them that threw you away, you ain't nothin' but gone
My gypsy biker's coming home

Now I'm out countin' white lines
'Countin white lines and getting stoned
My gypsy biker's coming home
The Rangers had a homecoming 
In Harlem late last night 
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine 
Over the Jersey state line 
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge 
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain 
The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants 
Together they take a stab at romance 
And disappear down Flamingo Lane 

Well the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo 
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl 
And the kids round here look just like shadows 
Always quiet, holding hands 
From the churches to the jails 
Tonight all is silence in the world 
As we take our stand 
Down in Jungleland 

The midnight gang's assembled 
And picked a rendezvous for the night 
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign 
That brings this fair city light 
Man there's an opera out on the Turnpike 
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley 
Until the local cops 
Cherry Tops 

Rips this holy night 
The street's alive 
As secret debts are paid 
Contacts made, they vanish unseen 
Kids flash guitars just like switch-blades 
Hustling for the record machine 
The hungry and the hunted 
Explode into rock'n'roll bands 
That face off against each other out in the street 
Down in Jungleland 

In the parking lot the visionaries 
Dress in the latest rage 
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing 
To the records that the DJ plays 
Lonely-hearted lovers 
Struggle in dark corners 
Desperate as the night moves on 
Just one look 
And a whisper, and they're gone 

Beneath the city two hearts beat 
Soul engines running through a night so tender 
In a bedroom locked 
In whispers of soft refusal 
And then surrender 
In the tunnels uptown 
The Rat's own dream guns him down 
As shots echo down them hallways in the night 
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away 
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light 
Outside the street's on fire 
In a real death waltz 
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy 
And the poets down here 
Don't write nothing at all 
They just stand back and let it all be 
And in the quick of the night 
They reach for their moment 
And try to make an honest stand 
But they wind up wounded 
Not even dead 
Tonight in Jungleland
A letter come blowing in on an ill wind
Something 'bout me and you never seeing one another again
Yeah, well I knew it'd come, still I was struck deaf and dumb
Like when we kissed, that taste of blood on your tongue

Don't worry darling, now baby don't you fret
We're living in the future and none of this has happened yet
Don't worry darling, now baby don't you fret
We're living in the future and none of this has happened yet

Woke up election day, skies gunpowder and shades of grey
Beneath a dirty sun I whistle my time away
Then just about sundown you come walking through town
Your boot heels clicking like the barrel of a pistol spinning round

Don't worry darling, now baby don't you fret
We're living in the future and none of this has happened yet
Don't worry darling, now baby don't you fret
We're living in the future and none of this has happened yet

The earth it gave away, the sea rose towards the sun
I opened up my heart to you, it got all damaged and undone
My ship Liberty sailed away on a bloody red horizon
The groundskeeper opened the gates and let the wild dogs run

[Instrumental]

I'm rolling through town, a lost cowboy at sundown
Got my monkey on a leash, got my ear tuned to the ground
My faith's been torn asunder, tell me is that rolling thunder
Or just the sinking sound of something righteous going under

Don't worry darling, now baby don't you fret
We're living in the future and none of this has happened yet
Don't worry darling, now baby don't you fret
We're living in the future and none of this has happened yet
Well now on a summer night oh in a dusky room
Come a little piece of the Lord's undying light, crying like he swallowed the fiery moon
In his mother's arms it was all the beauty I could take
Like the missing words to some prayer well that I could never make
Oh in a world so hard and dirty, so fouled and confused
Searching for a little bit of God's mercy, I found living proof

Well I put my heart and soul, babe, I put 'em high upon a shelf
Right next to the faith, the faith that I'd lost in myself
I went down into the desert city yeah just trying so hard to shed my skin
I crawled deep into some kind of darkness looking to burn out every, every trace of who I'd been
You do some sad sad things baby, oh when it's you you're trying to lose
You do some sad and hurtful things, I seen living proof

You shot through my anger and rage
To show me my prison was just an open, open cage
There were no keys, no guards
Oh just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars

Well now all that's sure on the boulevard
Is that life is just a house of cards
As fragile as each and every breath
Of this boy sleeping in our bed
Tonight let's lie beneath the eaves, babe
It' just a close band of happy thieves
And when that train comes we'll get on board
And steal what we can from the treasures, treasures of the Lord
It's been a long long drought baby, tonight the rain's pouring down on our roof
Oh looking for a little bit of God's mercy, I found living proof
Oh living proof
I found living proof
Yeah living proof
I found living proof
Oh living proof
I found living proof
Oh living proof
Yeah I found living proof
I found living proof
I found living proof
Oh yeah
Baby, once I thought I knew
Everything I needed to know about you
Your sweet whisper, your tender touch
But I didn't really know that much
The joke's on me, but it's gonna be okay
If I can just get through this lonesome day
Lonesome day

Hell's brewing, dark sun's on the rise
This storm will blow through by and by
House is on fire, viper's in the grass
A little revenge and this too shall pass
This too shall pass, darling, yeah I'm gonna pray
Right now, all I got's this lonesome day
Lonesome day

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright
Come on!

Better ask questions before you shoot
Deceit and betrayal's bitter fruit
It's hard to swallow, come time to pay
That taste on your tongue don't easily slip away
Let kingdom come, I'm gonna find my way
Yeah through this lonesome day
Lonesome day
Lonesome day
Lonesome day

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, (it's alright, yeah)
It's alright, (it's alright, it's alright, yeah)
It's alright, it's alright, (it's alright, yeah)
It's alright, it's alright, (it's alright, yeah)

Lonesome day
Lonesome day
Lonesome day
The ragamuffin gunner is returnin' home like a hungry runaway
He walks through town all alone
"He must be from the fort," he hears the high school girls say
This countryside's burnin' with wolfmen fairies dressed in drag for homicide
They hit and run, plead sanctuary, 'neath the holy stone they hide
They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception
And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood
Sticker smiles sweet as gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud
And I said, "Hey, gunner man, that's quicksand, that's quicksand that ain't mud
Have you thrown your senses to the war or did you lose them in the flood?"

That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced
Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight
He rides her low on the hip, on the side he's got Bound For Glory in red, white and blue flash paint
He leans on the hood telling racin' stories, the kids call him Jimmy The Saint
Well that blaze and noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin' point
He rides headfirst into a hurricane and disappears into a point
And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell
That is, nothin' left that you could sell
Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell
And I said, "Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil, that's blood"
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm
Or was he just lost in the flood?

Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air
Some storefront incarnation of Maria, she's puttin' on me the stare
And Bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware
Everything stops, you hear five quick shots, the cops come up for air
And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street
Whoa, that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose, but he gets blown right off his feet
Oh, and some kid comes blastin' round the corner, but a cop puts him right away
He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish
Still breathing when I walked away
And somebody said, "Hey man, did you see that? His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud"
I wonder what the dude was sayin', or was he just lost in the flood?
Well, hey man, did you see that, lord, those poor cats are sure messed up
I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they all just lost in the flood?
Were they lost, oh, tell me, tell me, man
Were they lost?
House got too crowded clothes got too tight
And I don't know just where I'm going tonight
Out where the sky's been cleared by a good hard rain
There's somebody callin' my secret name

I'm going down to Lucky Town
Going down to Lucky Town
I wanna lose these blues I've found
Down in Lucky Town
Down in Lucky Town

Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots
But that coat always had a tread hangin' loose
Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise
It led me right past your house and on over the rise

I'm going down to Lucky Town
Down to Lucky Town
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found
Down in Lucky Town
Down in Lucky Town
I had some victory that was just failure in deceit
Now the joke's comin' up through the soles of my feet
I been a long time walking on fortune's cane
Tonight I'm steppin' lightly and feelin' no pain

Well here's to your good looks baby now here's to my health
Here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves
When it comes to luck you make your own
Tonight I got dirt on my hands but I'm building me a new home

Down in Lucky Town
Down in Lucky Town
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found
Down in Lucky Town
Hey, Eddie, can you lend me a few bucks 
And tonight can you get us a ride 
Gotta make it through the tunnel 
Got a meeting with a man on the other side 

Hey Eddie, this guy, he's the real thing 
So if you want to come along 
You gotta promise you won't say anything 
'Cause this guy don't dance 
And the word's been passed this is our last chance 

We gotta stay cool tonight, Eddie 
'Cause man, we got ourselves out on that line 
And if we blow this one 
They ain't gonna be looking for just me this time 

And all we gotta do is hold up our end 
Here stuff this in your pocket 
It'll look like you're carrying a friend 
And remember, just don't smile 
Change your shirt, 'cause tonight we got style 

Well Cherry says she's gonna walk 
'Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it 
But Eddie, man, she don't understand 
That two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket 

And tonight's gonna be everything that I said 
And when I walk through that door 
I'm just gonna throw that money on the bed 
She'll see this time I wasn't just talking 
Then I'm gonna go out walking 

Hey Eddie, can you catch us a ride ?
You get up every morning at the sound of the bell 
You get to work late and the boss man's giving you hell 
Till you're out on a midnight run 
Losing your heart to a beautiful one 
And it feels right as you lock up the house 
Turn out the lights and step out into the night 

And the world is busting at its seams 
And you're just a prisoner of your dreams 
Holding on for your life 'cause you work all day 
To blow 'em away in the night 

The rat traps filled with soul crusaders 
The circuits lined and jammed with chromed invaders 
And she's so pretty that you're lost in the stars 
As you jockey your way through the cars 
And sit at the light, as it changes to green 
With your faith in your machine off you scream into the night 

And you're in love with all the wonder it brings 
And every muscle in your body sings as the highway ignites 
You work nine to five and somehow you survive till the night 
Hell all day they're busting you up on the outside 
But tonight you're gonna break on through to the inside 
And it'll be right, it'll be right, and it'll be tonight 

And you know she will be waiting there 
And you'll find her somehow you swear 
Somewhere tonight you run sad and free 
Until all you can see is the night
Can't see nothin' in front of me
Can't see nothin' coming up behind
I make my way through this darkness
I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me
Lost track of how far I've gone
How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
On my back's a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a half mile of line
Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight
Left the house this morning
Bells ringing filled the air
Wearin' the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here
Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight
Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li
There's spirits above and behind me
Faces gone black, eyes burnin' bright
May their precious blood bind me
Lord, as I stand before your fiery light
Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li
I see you mary in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
There's holy pictures of our children
Dancin' in a sky filled with light
May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mix with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancin' on the end of my line
Sky of blackness and sorrow ( a dream of life)
Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life)
Sky of glory and sadness ( a dream of life)
Sky of mercy, sky of fear ( a dream of life)
Sky of memory and shadow ( a dream of life)
Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight
Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life)
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life
Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight
With her killer graces
And her secret places
That no boy can fill
With her hands on her hips
Oh and that smile on her lips
Because she knows that it kills me
With her soft French cream
Standing in that doorway like a dream
I wish she'd just leave me alone
Because French cream won't soften them boots
And French kisses will not break that heart of stone
With her long hair falling
And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
Oh she's the one
She's the one

That thunder in your heart
At night when you're kneeling in the dark
It says you're never gonna leave her 
But there's this angel in her eyes
That tells such desperate lies
And all you want to do is believe her
And tonight you'll try 
Just one more time
To leave it all behind
And to break on through
Oh she can take you
But if she wants to break you
She's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
And no matte where you sleep
Tonight or how far you run
Oh she's the one
She's the one

Oh and just one kiss
She'd fill them long summer nights
With her tenderness
That secret pact you made
Back when her love could save you
From the bitterness
Oh she's the one
Oh she's the one
Oh she's the one
Oh she's the one

The screen door slams 
Mary' dress waves 
Like a vision she dances across the porch 
As the radio plays 
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely 
Hey that's me and I want you only 
Don't turn me home again 
I just can't face myself alone again 
Don't run back inside 
Darling you know just what I'm here for 
So you're scared and you're thinking 
That maybe we ain't that young anymore 
Show a little faith there's magic in the night 
You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright 
Oh and that's alright with me 

You can hide 'neath your covers 
And study your pain 
Make crosses from your lovers 
Throw roses in the rain 
Waste your summer praying in vain 
For a saviour to rise from these streets 
Well now I'm no hero 
That's understood 
All the redemption I can offer girl 
Is beneath this dirty hood 
With a chance to make it good somehow 
Hey what else can we do now ? 
Except roll down the window 
And let the wind blow 
Back your hair 
Well the night's busting open 
These two lanes will take us anywhere 
We got one last chance to make it real 
To trade in these wings on some wheels 
Climb in back 
Heaven's waiting on down the tracks 
Oh-oh come take my hand 
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land 
Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road 
Lying out there like a killer in the sun 
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run 
Oh Thunder Road sit tight take hold 
Thunder Road 

Well I got this guitar 
And I learned how to make it talk 
And my car's out back 
If you're ready to take that long walk 
From your front porch to my front seat 
The door's open but the ride it ain't free 
And I know you're lonely 
For words that I ain't spoken 
But tonight we'll be free 
All the promises'll be broken 
There were ghosts in the eyes 
Of all the boys you sent away 
They haunt this dusty beach road 
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets 
They scream your name at night in the street 
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet 
And in the lonely cool before dawn 
You hear their engines roaring on 
But when you get to the porch they're gone 
On the wind so Mary climb in 
It's town full of losers 
And I'm pulling out of here to win
