Breast Cancer Data<br />

<br /><body style="margin-right:200px;margin-left:200px;font-size:12pt">
This is sample breast cancer data from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.names">Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.</a>  The data is available <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data">here.</a> The data includes breast cancer diagnosis as either "Benign" or "Malignant".  The additional attributes include dimensions of the tumor cells.  For more information see the above link on the data.

<br>
The program used for this excercise was R.  It is a statistical programming language that has a number of machine learning libraries which offer many different options when considering classification data.  The breast cancer data was evaluated iteratively with a number of models.  The sensitivity of different models can also be iteratively tested.  Eventually the best classifying model was a rules training model, the table for the different models used and their respective accuracy can be seen below.<br />

<br>
The highest acccuracy achieved for this model was 96% of the diagnosis over 569 observations.  This is an example of machine learning capabilities in R applied to a sample dataset.  R utilizes many different types of models that cover a variety of predictive classfication techniques which can be applied to a variety of datasets.
